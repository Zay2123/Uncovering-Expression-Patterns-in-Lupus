## Uncovering-Expression-Patterns-in-Lupus

## Overview
This project analyzes gene expression data from the GEO database (GSE10325) to identify differentially expressed genes between Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients and healthy individuals.

## Tools & Packages
- R, GEOquery, limma, pheatmap
- PCA and heatmap clustering
- DEGs identified using empirical Bayes modeling

## Key Findings
- No clear separation of gene expression patterns between groups
- Immune and interferon-response genes were slighlty upregulated in SLE
